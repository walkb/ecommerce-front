# E-Commerce Front-end Case Study
Walker Broadbent - April 2024

# Back-end solution
This application relies on making calls to the Dummy API to artificially populate the website. Therefore, none of the cart actions are genuine and stored only locally, not on the database. Therefore, I opted not to make login capabilities (such as to save carts) as the login feature would be superficial and would not be making genuine calls, however I believe that would be an easy implementation given the back-end capabilities to do so.

# Front-end solution
React-router is the primary library used in this project, as I wanted to expand my working knowledge of popular Javascript and React libraries. As of now, I have some previous experience with Express.js on the back-end, and React, Next.js, and now React-Router on the front-end.

I concede that due to other time commitments, the styling of both the website itself and the code are not as clean as I would like it to be. However, as with all things computer science, the only way to improve on efficiency is to continue to practice and therefore regardless I believe there is value in this project.

Two of the icons in the current iteration of the website are not owned by me, as they were placeholders for other logos that did not end up making it into the repo before submission. This will be remedied in the near future as I create designs I am satisfied with. The placeholder image for the products was created by me.

# Installation and running
npm i and npm install should be the only two commands required to install and run this project.
